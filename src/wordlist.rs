//! wordlist.rs — Module to load and preprocess the crossword word list for Umiaq
//!
//! This module is responsible for reading a word list (either from a file, or from an in-memory
//! string — the latter is important for WebAssembly/browser builds, since direct file I/O
//! isn't allowed there).
//!
//! The output is a `WordList` struct containing a flat `Vec<String>` of lowercase words.
//! We do NOT store scores, because the solver only needs the word strings themselves.
//!
//! The parsing logic:
//! - Each line in the input is expected to be in the format `word;score`.
//! - Lines without a semicolon are skipped silently.
//! - `score` is parsed as an integer, and words with scores below `min_score` are skipped.
//! - Words longer than `max_len` are skipped.
//! - All words are normalized to lowercase.
//! - The final list is deduplicated and sorted by length first, then alphabetically.
//!
//! This module is designed to be **WASM-friendly** — no `std::fs` calls are made unless
//! we're on a native build. The public API provides:
//! - `parse_from_str(...)` — works everywhere, including WASM.
//! - `load_from_path(...)` — **native-only** convenience method to read from a file path.
//!
//! If compiled with `target_arch = "wasm32"`, only the WASM-safe parsing method is available
//! and `parse_from_str` is not (as it's currently unused in WASM builds)

/// Struct representing a processed, ready-to-use word list.
///
/// The `entries` vector contains all valid words (filtered, normalized, deduplicated),
/// already sorted by (length, alphabetical).
///
/// We intentionally store just the words themselves (`String`) because in this design
/// the solver does not require the associated scores during pattern matching.

    /// from the File API directly into this function.
    /// That said, we're not using this function in WASM at the moment.

    /// # Arguments
    /// * `contents`  — The raw file contents as a `&str`. Each line should be `word;score`.
    /// * `min_score` — Words with scores lower than this are skipped.
    /// * `max_len`   — Words longer than this are skipped.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `WordList` — Struct containing all valid entries.
    ///
    /// # Behavior:
    /// 1. Splits the input into lines.
    /// 2. Skips empty lines and lines without a `;` separator.
    /// 3. Splits each valid line into `word` and `score` parts.
    /// 4. Parses the score and filters by `min_score` and `max_len`.
    /// 5. Converts `word` to lowercase.
    /// 6. Deduplicates the list (case-insensitive because we lowercase early).
    /// 7. Sorts by length, then alphabetically.
